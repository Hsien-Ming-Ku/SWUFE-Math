# Test_matrices
Test matrices for (shifted) Krylov subspace methods.

Certainly, these matrices also can be used for investigating the performance 
of Krylov subspace method for A*x = b and the corresponding preconditioning 
techniques.

!!! NOTE:

Some test matrices for shifted Krylov subspace methods

(A - sigma_i *I) = b, sigma_i \in \mathbb{C}, i = 1,2,...,t.

These test matrices A are from the Numerical Linear Algebra Course of Prof. Gerard L.G. Sleijpen 
(Homepage: http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~sleij101/), 
And also some matrices come from two popular test matrix collections:

1. Matrix Market: http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/matrices.html
2. The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/

!!!! So please also ensure that the source for academic research only, not used for any commercial purposes.

!!!  I put them here just for the convenience of my research program.
