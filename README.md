Test matrices for shifted Krylov subspace methods.

!!! NOTE:

Some test matrices for shifted Krylov subspace methods

(A - sigma_i *I) = b, sigma_i \in \mathbb{C}, i = 1,2,...,t.

These test matrices A are from the Numerical Linear Algebra Course of Prof. Gerard L.G. Sleijpen 
(Homepage: http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~sleij101/),
