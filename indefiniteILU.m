function [L,U] = indefiniteILU(A)
% This function is to handle the ILU decomposition for (indefinite) matrix,
% it means that there are some zeros in its diagonal part, this situation
% is not suitable for using ILU decomposition directly. We give a simple
% strategy [1-2] for remedying this difficult. We denote the matrix as
%              A = (a_ij) \in mathcal{C}^{n\times n}
% then we obtain the A1 = A + epst*max(|a_ii|)*I_n, then we compute ILU
% decomposition of A1 for providing the ILU preconditioner for original
% coefficient matrix A.
