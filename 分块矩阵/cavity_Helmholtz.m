function [A,b] = cavity_Helmholtz(q,omega,theta)
% Let us consider the electromagnetic scattering problem from a large 
% rectangular cavity on the x-y plane in which the medium is y-directional 
% inhomogeneous. In the transverse magnetic polarization case, when the 
% model Helmholtz equation with positive wave number is discretized by 
% the five-point finite difference scheme with uniform stepsize h, we 
% obtain a block two-by-two system of linear equations with following form
%   A*x = b: 
%               A = [ B  E ]
%                   [ F  C ]
% q+1 means dividing [0,1] into q+1 parts.
% omega is a real constant
% theta â‰¥ 0 is a real constant
